# In this example we are going to calculate the salary of a camera salesman.
# His basic salary is 1500, 
# for every camera he will sell he will get 200 and the commission
# the monthâ€™s sale is 2%. The input will be number of cameras sold and 
# total price of the cameras.


# numb_cam = int ( input("Enter Number of Cam You have Sale :- ") )
# month_sale = int ( input("Enter Your Monthly Sale :- ") )

# basic = 1500
# commission = numb_cam * 200
# bonus = (2 * month_sale) / 100


# print( basic + commission + bonus )


# # print( "Basic is ", basic)
# # print( "Comm is ", commission)

# print( f"Basic is {basic}, Comm is {commission}, Bonus is {bonus} and Total is {basic + commission + bonus}" )
