API: application programming interface

1. Protocols (The Rules)

An API defines the communication protocols. The most common protocol for web APIs is 
HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol), using standard methods like:

HTTP Method,Action,Analogy
GET ,Retrieve data (read-only). ,"Asking the waiter , ""What soups do you have?"""
POST ,Create a new resource or submit data. ,Giving the waiter your dinner order.
PUT/PATCH ,Update an existing resource. ,Asking the waiter to replace a cold dish.
DELETE ,Remove a resource. ,Asking the waiter to clear the finished plates.


2. Endpoints (The Addresses)

Data Formats (The Language)

APIs usually exchange data using easy-to-read, universal formats:

    JSON (JavaScript Object Notation): The most common format due to its lightweight and human-readable structure. It's built on key-value pairs, making it easy for Python to work with (it converts directly to a Python dictionary).
    XML (eXtensible Markup Language): An older, structured format, still used by some legacy systems.

Types of APIs (Focusing on Web APIs)

While APIs exist everywhere (like Python's built-in functions), when people talk about APIs today, they usually mean one of these web service types:

1. REST APIs (Representational State Transfer)

    The Standard: REST is the architectural style that dominates the modern web. It uses standard HTTP methods (GET, POST, etc.) and URLs to manage resources.

    Stateless: Each request from the client to the server contains all the information needed to understand the request. The server doesn't need to save any past client interaction history between requests.

Why APIs are Essential:

    Microservices: APIs allow complex applications to be broken into smaller, independent services (microservices) that communicate seamlessly.
    Integration: They allow third-party services (like Google Maps, Twitter, or PayPal) to be integrated directly into any application.
    Abstraction: They hide complexity. A developer doesn't need to know how a weather service collects its data; they only need to know how to call the weather API to get the result.
